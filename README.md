# **Picture in Picture**
### made in JavaScript

## **About the project**

The project:
1. Uses **a screen capture API**
2. Create **a virtual second screen**
3. Allows you to **move and resize** the second screen
 
## **How it works**

First, open the tab that you want to use as a picture in a picture. Go to the screen with the Picture in Picture project and refresh it. **The display media method** in the screen capture allows you to select what screen, application, or tab you can use. Pick the thing that you want to use and click „share" button.

It will jump back over to the screen that we’re sharing. Return to the project and press „start" to initialize the picture in picture (on the top you have a notification that you're sharing).You can **move it, resize it, and it will stay on top of everything,** allowing you to have essentially a virtual second screen.
